<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This project made as a class assignment.It's purpose basically found some association rules in given input.

**Features:**

* You can find association rules on any given data in csv format
* You can filter it with minimum support and three different second measurement types
* You can see how many rules found and each rules measurement values
* You can see list of frequent subsets

### What is Apriori algorithm ?

Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis. The Apriori algorithm was proposed by Agrawal and Srikant in 1994. Apriori is designed to operate on databases containing transactions (for example, collections of items bought by customers, or details of a website frequentation or IP addresses)
